please note:

- this is only a list to see the old compatibility, do not open new issues here
- if the list doesn't contain a certain game ID, it probably wasn't tested
- you can point out the missing game if you tested it, it'll be added (maybe)
- last tested emulator version was 0.6.0, current version is 0.7.0
- the compatibility does not include WIP builds like 0.6.1, 0.5.1...etc
